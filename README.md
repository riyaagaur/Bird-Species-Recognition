# Bird-Species-Recognition

## Project Overview
This project aims to classify bird species from images using deep learning techniques. We developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) model that accurately identifies bird species from a diverse dataset of bird images.

## Features
- Bird species identification using CNN.
- Dataset includes over 200 bird species.
- Data augmentation for improved generalization.
- Model achieved 85% accuracy on the test set.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebooks

## Dataset
The dataset contains bird images from various sources, preprocessed for training. 

## Results
- Model accuracy: 85%

## Future Work
- Improve model accuracy by fine-tuning hyperparameters.
- Explore other architectures like ResNet and EfficientNet.
- Deploy the model using a web app.
